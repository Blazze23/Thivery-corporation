      <p class="about-paragraph">
        Thievery Corporation is an American electronic music duo consisting of
        Rob Garza and Eric Hilton. Their musical style mixes elements of dub,
        acid jazz, reggae, Indian classical, Middle Eastern music, hip hop,
        electronica, and Brazilian music, including bossa nova.
      </p>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        Thievery Corporation was formed in the summer of 1995 at Washington
        D.C.'s Eighteenth Street Lounge. Rob Garza and Lounge co-owner Eric
        Hilton were drawn together over their mutual love of club life, as well
        as dub, bossa nova and jazz records. They decided to see what would come
        of mixing all these in a recording studio, and from this, in 1996 the
        duo started their Eighteenth Street Lounge Music record label.The duo
        drew attention with their first two 12-inch offerings, "Shaolin
        Satellite" and "2001: a Spliff Odyssey", and with their 1996 debut LP,
        Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi.

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        In 2002 they released The Richest Man in Babylon on their ESL label.
        This fifteen-track album is similar in sound and timbre to their earlier
        2000 release, The Mirror Conspiracy, and features performances by
        vocalists Emilíana Torrini, Pam Bricker, and Loulou. In 2001, they
        released Sounds From The Verve Hi-Fi, a "best of" compilation of
        1960s–1970s material of Verve Records that includes Jazz, Bossa Nova and
        Latin Jazz works from artists like Cal Tjader, Wes Montgomery, Sérgio
        Mendes & Brasil '66, Luiz Bonfá, among others.

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        In 2004, they released The Cosmic Game, which has a darker, more
        psychedelic sound than The Richest Man in Babylon. The album also
        featured more high-profile guest singers on it, including Perry Farrell,
        David Byrne, and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips.

        In 2006, the group released Versions, a selection of remixes by Thievery
        Corporation for other artists. They toured around the United States,
        playing at Lollapalooza. The tour was photographed by Rob Myers,
        Thievery Corporation's sitar and guitar player, in the Blurb photo book
        Thievery Corporation 2006. In 2006, the band also recorded "Sol Tapado"
        for the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin Redux
        produced by the Red Hot Organization. As well, in the 2006 release of
        Tiger Woods PGA Tour for Xbox, their music was featured as the
        soundtrack to the game. Also in 2006, Puma Ptah, then known as Ras Puma,
        joined and toured with Thievery Corporation and continues to tour with
        them today.

        The group released their fifth studio album, Radio Retaliation, on
        September 23, 2008. It was nominated for the Grammy for best recording
        package. Thievery Corporation's tour started out with five consecutive
        sold-out shows at the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC. They were the opening
        act on August 1, 2009, for Paul McCartney at FedExField in Landover,

        On July 27, 2010, Babylon Central, the cinematic directorial debut of
        founding member Eric Hilton, was released. Set (and shot) in Washington,
        D.C., the film follows tripwire events in the interconnected lives of
        its characters, each influencing power brokers' schemes to manipulate
        international currencies.
      </p>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        In June 2011, Thievery Corporation released their sixth album, Culture
        of Fear, which also featured the vocal stylings of Puma Ptah, then known
        as Ras Puma, on the tracks: "Overstand" and "False Flag Dub."

        In January 2012, Thievery Corporation launched a remixes contest in
        conjunction with Dubspot. The same year, Eric Hilton from Thievery
        Corporation produced the debut album, Archives, for Washington D.C.
        based reggae band "The Archives."

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        The band released Saudade on March 25, 2014, via ESL Music. On January
        11, 2017, the band released the song "Ghetto Matrix" from their album
        The Temple of I & I, which was released on February 10, 2017, again via

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        On April 20, 2018, the band released Treasures from the Temple via ESL
        Music. Throughout their career, the duo has repeatedly expressed their
        fondness for Brazilian culture in interviews and liner notes of their
        releases, especially of the 1960s Bossa Nova music movement. Some of
        their earlier recordings were accompanied by artwork paying specific
        homage to classic releases by bossa nova artists like João Gilberto (his
        self-titled 1973 album) or Tom Jobim (Stone Flower). Their 1997 debut
        album is also dedicated to the memory of Brazilian musician Antonio
        Carlos Jobim, who died three years earlier.

        The language of the group's lyrics throughout their career include
        English, Spanish, French, Italian, Persian, Portuguese, Romanian and
        Hindi. This reflects the group's world music influences.
